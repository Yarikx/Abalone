	<string name="rules">The board consists of 61 circular spaces arranged
		in a hexagon, five on a side. Each player has 14 marbles that rest in
		the spaces and are initially arranged as shown at left.\nPlay
		alternates between the players one move at a time, with the black
		marbles moving first. For each move, a player moves a line of one, two
		or three one space.\nThe move can be either in-line (parallel to the
		line of marbles) or broadside (not parallel to the line of marbles),
		as illustrated at right.\n

		A player can push their opponentâ€²s marbles which are in an adjacent
		space to their own with an in-line move only. They can only push if
		the pushing line has more marbles than the pushed line (three can push
		two or one; two can push one).\nMarbles must be pushed into an open
		space (i.e. not blocked by a marble of either colour).\nThe winner is
		the first player to gain six opposing marbles from the opponent.
